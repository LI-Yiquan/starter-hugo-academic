I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and expecting to graduate in 2025. I transferred to the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 2023, before that I spend 2.5 years at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My interest lies in 3D scene understanding and adversarial learning.
